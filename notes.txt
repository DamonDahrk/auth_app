 naming conventions hyper important!
 
Next.js streamlines routing by using folder structure and naming conventions: place backend route files as route.ts/js inside an api directory, and frontend pages as page.tsx.

This eliminates the need for explicit route configuration; Next.js automatically understands and maps routes based on file and folder names, reducing boilerplate and manual redirects.

The tradeoff is stricter adherence to naming conventions and file structure, but overall, it increases productivity and maintains cleaner code.

Unlike Express, which is centered entirely around server routing, Next.js abstracts much of the routing logic, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing the server.

A salt value is a random string of data that is added to a password before it is hashed by a cryptographic hash function. Salting ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashes will be different because each will have a unique salt added to the password before hashing.

A toast in web development is a small, temporary, non-intrusive notification message that appears on the screen to provide feedback to users

The cookie is automatically sent with subsequent requests to the server, allowing the backend to authenticate the user by verifying this token without requiring the user to log in again.

NEXT REQUEST : It encapsulates all information about the incoming HTTP request (headers, method, URL, cookies, etc.).
